# cpp_oop_project
Created a Data Flow machine in C++ capable of calculating polynomial expressions in simulated time and manipulating simulated memory, using the Discrete Event Simulation Engine via the provided API

The code I wrote is located in 'oop_pr' folder.

NOTE : The version of the fully, bug-free, working software is, unfortunately, unavailable at the moment. This was my faculty project and a lot of modifications were done in the laboratories at the faculty which, eventually led to the fully working and clean-written code. Unfortunately, those modifications are unavailable now
